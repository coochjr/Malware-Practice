# Malware-Practice
This is just a repository of all the simple malware that i have created as a demonstration of my Red Team Skills. This simple malware project has no harmful code and is just a mere understanding of how it a simple malware can be created. So far i have just demonstrated how to get a windows popup associated with a notepad file and pulling the ID of an application.
